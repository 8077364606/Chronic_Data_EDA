# Chronic Data Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a chronic disease dataset. The goal is to clean the data, handle missing values, and uncover key insights through data visualization. The project also includes interactive graphs to enhance the understanding of data patterns and trends.

## Objectives

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating interactive plots to visualize trends, distributions, and correlations.
- **Interactive Graphs**: Plotting user-friendly graphs for in-depth data exploration.
- **Insights**: Extracting meaningful insights and trends from the data.
- **Conclusions**: Drawing actionable conclusions based on the analysis.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loaded the dataset.
   - Checked for missing values and null entries.
   - Cleaned the dataset by handling null values and outliers.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Used libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly` for interactive plots.
   - Visualized distributions, relationships, and correlations between variables.

3. **Insights**:
   - Derived key insights into factors influencing chronic conditions.
   - Highlighted patterns and anomalies in the dataset.

4. **Conclusions**:
   - Summarized actionable findings from the data analysis.
   - Provided recommendations based on data trends.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For static data visualizations.
- **Plotly**: For interactive graphs.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

## How to Use

1. Install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install sklearn,
   pandas,
   numpy,
   matplotlib,
   seaborn,
   plotly,
   sklearn
   ```
3. Run the analysis script:
   ```bash
   python analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Results

- Comprehensive analysis of chronic disease factors.
- Interactive visualizations to explore data trends.
- Insights and conclusions for potential areas of concern.
